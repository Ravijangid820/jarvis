## 2026-06-16 — Hardening, refactor & documentation

### Security
- **Removed the master API key entirely.** Auth is now web-login sessions or per-user, revocable
  `api_keys`. The voice listener uses a real key (`config/voice_listener.key`); added
  `src/scripts/manage.py` (create-admin / reset-password / mint-key) for bootstrap & recovery.
- Real server-side logout (`/auth/logout`), expired-session purge, per-user rate limiting
  (admins included), admin-panel XSS escaping, configurable CORS, `system_prompt` length cap.

### Correctness / memory
- **Fixed the critical context-window bug**: `-c 4096` + char-based prompt token-budgeting that
  clamps history and completion so context is never silently evicted.
- Merged system prompt + profile + RAG into a single system message (Qwen template requirement).
- Wired Piper TTS into the streaming endpoint; surfaced stream errors instead of storing them as
  replies; never lose the user's turn on failure.
- Reworked the shared `default` session into per-user sessions with strict ownership checks.
- RAG: cosine space + correct embeddinggemma query/document prefixes, semantic fact dedup,
  user-scoped recall, background (off-request-path) embedding; one-time `reembed_memory.py` migration.

### Engineering
- **Split the 1,300-line `main.py`** into an acyclic module graph
  (`config → {db, auth, llm} → memory → chat → main`).
- Added pytest + ruff + GitHub Actions CI; reconciled `schema.sql` (dropped unused FTS5 tables);
  lifespan handler; safe LLM-response parsing; SQLite `busy_timeout`; log rotation; systemd hardening.
- First clean git history (secrets + multi-GB binaries gitignored); full self-audit in `AUDIT.md`.
- Rewrote the documentation set: `ARCHITECTURE`, `WORKFLOWS`, `API`, `SPECS`, `DEPLOY`, docs index.

## 2026-06-02 — Major Improvement Session

### Added
- API key authentication for orchestrator (Bearer token, constant-time comparison)
- Rate limiting (30 req/min per IP, in-memory tracking)
- Input validation (max 500 characters, Pydantic model)
- Request timeouts (120s on LLM calls)
- Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Cache-Control)
- SQLite memory integration (conversation history + FTS5 full-text search)
- Context injection (last 10 messages sent to LLM with each query)
- `/health` endpoint (no auth required)
- `/history` endpoint (retrieve conversation history)
- `llama-fast.service` systemd unit (auto-start 2B model)
- `jarvis-orchestrator.service` systemd unit (auto-start orchestrator)
- `run_listener.sh` with API key auth for voice bridge
- `--reasoning off` flag on llama-server to disable Qwen3.5 thinking mode
- `/no_think` directive in system prompt
- `vm.swappiness=10` in sysctl.conf
- Whisper small.en model downloaded for benchmarking
- `/srv/jarvis/` structured project directory

### Changed
- RAM upgraded from 6 GB to 8 GB
- Whisper.cpp rebuilt with explicit `GGML_AVX=ON` (was OFF due to LXC auto-detection failure)
- Whisper.cpp rebuilt with `WHISPER_SDL2=ON` for microphone capture
- Orchestrator rewritten from scratch with security hardening
- LLM response time reduced from 60+ seconds to 5-15 seconds (thinking mode disabled)

### Removed
- `ai-fast-brain.service` (replaced by `llama-fast.service`)
- `ai-reasoning-brain.service` (4B model disabled to conserve RAM)
- 4B model server (model file retained on disk for future use)

### Benchmark Results
- **Qwen3.5-2B**: 5.75 t/s prompt, 3.67 t/s generation (with --reasoning off)
- **Whisper base.en**: 83.5s for 11s audio (7.6x realtime) — SELECTED
- **Whisper small.en**: 364.3s for 11s audio (33.1x realtime) — too slow
