# Workflows

How the moving parts actually behave at runtime. File references point at the orchestrator
modules under `src/orchestrator/`.

---

## 1. A chat request (`/inbox` and `/chat/stream`)

Both endpoints share the same front-matter (`_validate_chat` in `main.py`); `/inbox` returns one
JSON blob, `/chat/stream` streams Server-Sent Events.

```
client → POST /inbox|/chat/stream  (Bearer token)
  1. auth middleware (main.py)      → resolve user from session token or API key
                                      → per-user rate limit (429 if exceeded)
  2. _validate_chat                 → trim text, length check, resolve_session, ownership check
  3. chat.build_messages            → assemble the prompt within the token budget  (see §2)
  4. chat.clamp_completion_for      → cap max_tokens so prompt + answer fit -c 4096
  5. memory.Inflight()              → mark a generation active (blocks the fact worker)
  6. llm.request_llm[_stream]       → call llama-server at 127.0.0.1:8081
  7. chat.store_message ×2          → persist user + assistant turns (enqueues embedding async)
  8. _maybe_title                   → on the first real turn, a 1-line LLM call titles the chat
  9. (optional) llm.synthesize_tts  → Piper renders the answer to base64 WAV when voice_feedback
```

Notes:
- The **user turn is persisted even on failure** so input is never lost; an error is surfaced as a
  real SSE `error` event, never written into history as if it were the assistant's reply.
- Session `"default"` (or a missing id) resolves to a real, per-user session `u<id>-default`
  (`chat.resolve_session`) — there is no shared, unowned bucket.

## 2. Prompt assembly & the token budget  (`chat.build_messages`, `budget.py`)

The model server runs with a **fixed context window** (`-c 4096`). The total of
`prompt tokens + generated tokens` must fit, or llama.cpp silently evicts the oldest prompt
tokens — which previously dropped the system prompt or the question itself.

The prompt is built as **exactly one system message + recent history + the current turn**:

```
[ system ]  =  base system prompt
               + USER PROFILE block   (all stored facts, capped at KNOWLEDGE_TOKEN_CAP=512 tok)
               + RECALLED MEMORIES    (RAG hits from past sessions; see §3)
[ history ]  = most-recent turns, newest-first, added only while they fit the remaining budget
[ user ]     = the current message  (always kept)
```

Token counting uses a deliberately conservative **char-based estimate** (`~4 chars/token`,
`budget.estimate_tokens`) — there is no tokenizer in-process. The budget:

```
prompt_budget = MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS − reserved_completion − PROMPT_SAFETY_MARGIN
```

`clamp_completion` then caps the requested `n_predict` to whatever the window has left after the
assembled prompt, never below `MIN_COMPLETION_TOKENS=64`. These pure functions live in `budget.py`
and are covered by `tests/test_budget.py`.

---

## 3. Long-term memory (RAG)  (`memory.py`)

Two complementary stores:

- **`user_knowledge`** (SQLite) — curated, full-sentence facts ("The user lives in Pune"), injected
  wholesale into the system prompt (capped). Survives chat deletion.
- **ChromaDB `jarvis_memory_cos`** — every message embedded as a vector for semantic recall.

**Embedding** uses `google/embeddinggemma-300m`, which is *asymmetric* — documents and queries need
different prompt prefixes:
- documents: `"title: none | text: <content>"`  (`memory._embed_documents`)
- queries:   `"task: search result | query: <text>"`  (`memory._embed_query`)

The collection uses **cosine** space with normalized vectors; `RAG_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD = 0.6`
(cosine distance = 1 − similarity) discards weak matches. Retrieval (`retrieve_long_term_memory`):
queries the user's own past **user-spoken** lines (assistant chatter is excluded — it crowds out
real facts), skips anything already in the recent context window, dedupes, and returns a block.

**Embeddings never run inline.** `chat.store_message` calls `memory.enqueue_embedding`, and a
dedicated daemon thread (`memory._embedding_worker`) drains the queue and writes vectors — so a
slow 300M forward pass on a no-AVX2 CPU never blocks the chat response.

---

## 4. Idle-time fact extraction  (`memory.py`)

A background thread (`memory._memory_worker`) builds the user-knowledge base without ever competing
with live chat:

```
every IDLE_CHECK_INTERVAL (30 s):
  if a chat request is in flight (memory.is_busy())            → skip
  if last activity < IDLE_THRESHOLD_SECONDS (120 s) ago        → skip
  else: pull up to 20 un-extracted user messages
        → LLM call with FACT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT (JSON array out)
        → store_fact() each, deduped semantically               (see §5)
        → mark exactly those messages processed
```

The **in-flight guard** matters: at ~5 tok/s a long answer can outlast the 120 s idle threshold,
so idle-time alone isn't enough — `Inflight` (a context manager around every generation) ensures
the extractor waits for the single LLM slot.

---

## 5. Fact dedup  (`memory.store_fact` / `_find_duplicate_fact`)

New facts are merged into an existing one only if they're a true **semantic restatement**:
the new fact and existing facts in the same category are embedded in one batch, and merged when
cosine similarity ≥ `FACT_DEDUP_SIM (0.90)`. (If the embedding model is unavailable, a stricter
word-overlap fallback at `0.85` is used.) This avoids the old bug where "lives in Pune" and
"lives in Delhi" — which share most words — were wrongly treated as the same fact.

---

## 6. The voice loop  (`src/scripts/run_listener.sh`)

```
mic → whisper-command (wake word "Jarvis")
    → transcribe the following sentence
    → curl POST http://localhost:5000/inbox  (Bearer = config/voice_listener.key)
    → orchestrator runs the chat workflow (§1)
    → [voice_feedback] Piper WAV in the response → play on the speaker
```

The listener authenticates with a **real, revocable API key** (an `api_keys` row, read from
`config/voice_listener.key`) — not a special bypass. The key also identifies *which user* the
voice conversation belongs to, so it lands in that user's history and memory.

---

## 7. Auth & sessions  (`main.py` middleware, `auth.py`)

```
POST /auth/login  → verify PBKDF2 hash → issue a 30-day session token (auth_sessions)
every request     → middleware checks: 1) session token  2) per-user API key
                    → 401 (no/malformed header) · 403 (bad token) · 429 (rate limit)
POST /auth/logout → delete the session row server-side (real revocation)
```

There is **no master key**. Bootstrap and lockout recovery use the local CLI
`src/scripts/manage.py` (`create-admin`, `reset-password`, `mint-key`).
